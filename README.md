cd Device_API/
```

### 2. Build the project (generate the `.jar` file)

```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

This will generate the file:  
`target/device-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### 3. Run with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and running. Then execute:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start a PostgreSQL container on port `5432`
