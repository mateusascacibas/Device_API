## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/device-api.git
cd device-api
```

### 2. Build the project (generate the `.jar` file)

```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

This will generate the file:  
`target/device-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### 3. Run with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and running. Then execute:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start a PostgreSQL container on port `5432`
- Build and run the API on port `8080`

```

## Test Coverage with JaCoCo

To generate a coverage report using JaCoCo, run:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

After running the tests, open the following file in your browser to view the coverage report:

```bash
target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

You will be able to see coverage for classes, methods, lines, and branches.
